A repository for files related to the presentation at the IUSSP International Population Conference 2017 in Cape Town/South Africa
We aim to analyze how social position (the socioeconomic gradient) affects your health after the transition to retirment.
Abstract:

Background: Adjustments to the crisis stricken Spanish public pension system are generally directed at a prolongation
of working life and the incorporation of average life expectancy in the pension base formula. By
ignoring heterogeneity with regard to survival and wellbeing, these changes possibly enhance existing social
inequalities in the retired population.
Method: The impact of socioeconomic and demographic indicators on survival of retired individuals is estimated
by applying stratified Cox Proportional Hazard regression models to a linked register based data set
covering the Andalusian census population between 2011 and 2016.
Results: Estimates suggest a higher relative mortality risk for men with lower pensions even after controlling
for relevant sociodemographic impact factors. According to our findings, women’s survival is not significantly
affected by income inequalities on an individual level. When household income is accounted for, the results
indicate a vastly increased relative risk for females in low income households which is only exceed by their
male counterparts.
Conclusion: Findings confirm substantial socioeconomic mortality differences in retired population of Southern
Spain, in particular for men. Future adaptations of pension systems essentially need to account for structural
life course differences and its consequences for future population health and longevity.
Contribution: This paper extents the literature on income and wealth related inequalities in longevity by analyzing
survival time differences of the retired population of Andalusia dependent on pension income and
other sociodemographic factors. It is furthermore attempted to highlight potential pitfalls of recent adaptations
of public pension system in Spain with regard to social fairness.


The file will contain various R Code files following a (hopefully) coherent description.

010 - Will contain a code for a descriptive analysis of aggregated mortality data of Southern European countries to set the analysis
the right context.

020 - this file contains code which manages the data from the Institute for Cartography and Statistic of Andalusia (ICEA) - renaming, new categories etc.
