A repository for files related to the presentation at the IUSSP International Population Conference 2017 in Cape Town/South Africa
We aim to analyze how social position (the socioeconomic gradient) affects your health after the transition to retirment.
Abstract:

Background: After decades of exceptional mortality improvements paired with low fertility South European
societies have to face the challenges of heavy population aging. Especially the prospect of large baby boomer
cohorts approaching retirement age raises concerns about the sustainability of social security and pension
funds. For the adjustment and reformation of pension systems, it will be essential to address the socioeconomic
health gradient and mechanism behind structural inequalities in the retired population. In particular
with regard to aspects of social fairness, the quantification of existing inequalities in health and mortality
within the retired population can contribute to the anticipation of prospective effects on the population health.
Method: We analyze the impact of several socioeconomic and demographic indicators on mortality during
the transition to retirement by using a relative underused time-to-event approach. Flexible parametric models
apply cubic splines to fit a baseline failure rate in a survival process and have advantageous properties compared
to the widely used Cox PH model. This analysis is conducted, using the ”Base de Datos Longitudinal de
Poblaci´on de Andaluc´ia” (BDLPA), a register-based individual level data base which is linked to the Andalusian
social security data set NIS for the years 2011 to 2015.
Results: We identify a clear socio-economic health gradient for Spanish men. Their pension income, their education
and especially the kind of last occupation determine their survival. The difference between a . . . and
. . . in terms of life expectancy are about . . . years. Notably, the findings for women are ambiguous. Neither
the education, the occupation before retirement nor the pension size can explain differences in health and survival.


The file will contain various R Code files following a (hopefully) coherent description.

010 - Will contain a code for a descriptive analysis of aggregated mortality data of Southern European countries to set the analysis
the right context.

020 - this file contains code which manages the data from the Institute for Cartography and Statistic of Andalusia (ICEA) - renaming, new categories etc.
